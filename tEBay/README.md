# tEBay g
A full-stack auction-like program that uses Java, CSS, HTML, Javascript, and PostgreSQL. It utilizes Vue.js and Spring Boot as the frameworks to the client and server-side of the application. tEBay replicates similar functions to a silent auction, in being able to create, update, place bids on, log prior bids, and delete auctions.
